A dream is a dream only to the dreamer
Let alone no one cares
No one cares if let alone
And yet our dreams are important
If only to our dreams.

And in our dreams, we are silent spectators
We scream but are not heard,
We hear but cannot listen,
And in this way our dreams are demons
Haunting us forever and ever until they die

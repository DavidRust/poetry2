A dream (Inception) within a dream.

Edgar Allan Poe, the famous poet and author. (if I am not mistaken).

Take this kiss upon thy brow...
And other poetry-like words.
And yet another poetry-like line of words.
Lineage.
More lines of poetry...
And yet another line.
Whoof, this is sucking.
line ... line ... line
another ... another ... another
But even more gets added ... it's madness!
